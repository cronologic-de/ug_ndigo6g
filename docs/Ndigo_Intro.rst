The **Ndigo5G** is a digitizer and transient recorder designed to sample
relatively shorts pulses in rapid repetition. It produces a stream of
output packets, each containing data from a single trigger event
together with a timestamp.


By default the **Ndigo5G** is equipped with a passive cooling system. If
necessary, the unit might be ordered with an active cooling system on demand ( `see Figure 1.1 <#target-link1>`_ ).
