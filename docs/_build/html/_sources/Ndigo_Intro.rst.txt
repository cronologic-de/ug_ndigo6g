(see `Fig <#target-link1>`_ ).

The **Ndigo5G** is a digitizer and transient recorder designed to sample
relatively shorts pulses in rapid repetition. It produces a stream of
output packets, each containing data from a single trigger event
together with a timestamp.


By default the **Ndigo5G** is equipped with a passive cooling system. If
necessary, the unit might be ordered with an active cooling system on demand ( `see Figure 1.1 <#target-link1>`_ ).

Features
--------


-  **10 bit** dynamic range

-  up to **5 Gsps** sample rate (in 1 channel mode) for increased resolution in time domain.

-  up to **4 channels** for your individual measurement setups.

-  digital input with TDC that can also be used for gating and
   triggering.

-  2\ :sup:`nd` digital input for gating or triggering.

-  PCIe 4x 1.1 with **800 MB/s throughput** for simple and fast data transfer to most PCs.

-  multiple boards can be synchronized via reference clock if more channels are required.

-  extension board available with 4 additional digital inputs.
