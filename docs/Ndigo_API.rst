Initialization
--------------

**int ndigo_count_devices (int**  * **error_code, char** ** **error message)**

Return the number of boards that are supported by this driver in the system.

**int ndigo_get_default_init_parameters(ndigo_init_parameters** * **init)**

Get a set of default parameters to feed into **ndigoinit().**

This must always be used to initialize the **ndigo_init_parameter** structure.

**ndigo_device**  * **ndigo_init(ndigo_init_parameters** * **params, int** * **error_code, char** ** **error_message)**

Open and initialize the Ndigo board with the given index. With **error_code** and **error_message**
the user must provide pointers where to buffers where error information should be written by the driver. The
buffer for the error message must by at least **80 chars** long.

Params is a structure of type **ndigo_init_parameters** that must be
completely initialized.

**int ndigo_close(ndigo_device**  * **device)**

Finalize the driver for this device.


Structure ndigo_init_parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**int version**

Must be set to **NDIGO_API_VERSION**

**int card_index**

The index in the list of **Ndigo5G** boards that should be initialized.
There might be multiple boards in the system that are handled by this
driver as reported by **ndigo_count_devices**. This index selects one of
them. Boards are enumerated depending on the PCIe slot. The lower the
bus number and the lower the slot number the lower the card index.

int board_id
This 8 bit number is filled into each packet created by the board and
is useful if data streams of multiple boards will be merged. If only
**Ndigo5G** cards are used this number can be set to the card index. If
boards of different types that use a compatible data format are used
in a system each board should get a unique id.

Can be changed with int ndigosetboardid(ndigodevice*device, int boardid).

**ndigo_bool_t use_external_clock**

Use 10MHz clock supplied by IPC flat band cable. Must be set for all slaves.

**ndigo_bool_t drive_external_clock**

**int sync_delay**

Fine tap delay for incoming sync signals.

**ndigo_bool_t force_window_calibration**

If **true/1**, valid data window is detected at initialization. Default value is **false/0:**
values from flash memory are used in order to set data window to correct position.

**ndigo_bool_t hptdc_sync_enabled**

A **HPTDC** is connected to this board. Enables the clock and sync line
from the **Ndigo5G** to the **HPTDC**.

**__int64 buffer_size[8]**

The minimum size of the DMA buffer. If set to 0 the default size of
16MByte is used. **Ndigo5G** only uses **buffer_size[0]**.

**int buffer_type**

Must be set to **NDIGO_BUFFER_ALLOCATE**.

**__int64 buffer_address**

Ignored. Might be used for future buffer types.

**int variant**

Set to 0. Can be used to activate future device variants such as
different base frequencies.

    #define CRONO_DEVICE_HPTDC 0

    #define CRONO_DEVICE_NDIGO5G 1

    #define CRONO_DEVICE_NDIGO250M 2


**int_dma read_delay**

This structure contains information about the board that does not
change during run time.

**int ndigo_get_param_info(ndigo device *device, ndigo_param_info *info)**

The structure returned by this call contains information that changes
indirectly due to configuration changes.

**int ndigo_get_fast_info(ndigo device *device, ndigo_fast_info *info)**

The bit mapping is described in section`Structure_ndigo_trigger_block`_ on page 22.

**int auto_trigger_period**

**int auto_trigger_random_exponent**

Create a trigger either periodically or randomly. There are two parameters
**M =** trigger_period and **N =** random_exponent that result in a distance between triggers of

**lut_func custom _lut**

Lookup table. If the output_mode is set to **NDIGO_OUTPUT_MODE_CUSTOM** or
to **NDIGO_OUTPUT_MODE_CUSTOM_INL**, this function is used for mapping
from ADC value to output value. The driver will call this function with a value
from **-1** to **+1** and the function must return the corresponding signed 16 bit value
that the board should return for an input voltage relative to the full scale range.

**typedef short (*lut func)(int channel, float x)**

This can be used e.g. for custom INL, offset and gain correction that covers user front end
electronics. It can also invert the signal or correct the effect of logarithmic input amplifiers etc.

The LUT is applied on the board, thus using it does not cause any additional CPU load.
In the mode **NDIGO_OUTPUT_MODE_CUSTOM_INL** the on-board INL correction table is
applied before the user function, while **NDIGO_OUTPUT_MODE_CUSTOM** does not perform
INL correction. In order to use the user lookup table functionality, **lut_func** must be set to a
pointer to the LUT-function


Structure ndigo trigger

**double minimum_free_packets;**

This parameter sets how many packets are supposed to t into the on-board FIFO
before a new packet is recorded after the FIFO was full, i.e. a certain amount of free
space in the FIFO is demanded before a new packet is written after the FIFO was full.

As a measure for the packet length the gate length set by the user is used.
The on-board algorithm checks the free FIFO space only in case the FIFO is full.
Therefore, if this number is **1.0** or more, at least every second packet in the DMA
buffer is guaranteed to have the full length set by the gate length parameters.
In many cases smaller values will also result in full length packets. But below
a certain value multiple packets that are cut off at the end will show up.


Structure ndigo gating block

**ndigo_bool_t retrigger**

Defaults to false. If retriggering is enabled, the timer is reset to the value of the start parameter
whenever the input signal is set while waiting to reach the stop time.

**ndigo_bool_t extend**

Defaults to true. If set, a gate is created with the set timing from the first occurrence of the
input trigger even for short gates. If not set, the input signal must persist for the gate to be
created. This feature is **NOT YET IMPLEMENTED.**


**ndigo_bool_t reserved1**

Defaults to false. Do not change.

**int start**

In multiples of **3.2ns**. The time from the first input signal seen in the idle state until the gating
output is set. The value of start needs to be less or equal to the stop value. Maximum value for
start and stop is :math:`2^{16}-1`.

**int stop**

In multiples of **3.2ns**. Maximum allowed value is :math:`2^{16}-1`.

Structure ndigo extension block
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


This structure configures how the inputs from the optional extension board and signals from
the synchronization bus are merged.


**ndigo_bool_t enable**

Enable routing of digital signal from Ndigo extension board to the according **BUSx** trigger unit.


**ndigo_bool_t ignore_cable**

If **false** input signal and BUS signal are **OR** ed before routing to the according

**BUSx** trigger unit. Otherwise only the signal from **Ndigo extension board** is used.



Run Time Control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


**int ndigo_start_capture(ndigo_device *device)**

**int ndigo_pause_capture(ndigo_device *device)**

**int ndigo_continue_capture(ndigo_device *device)**

Call this to resume data acquisition after a call to ndigo_pause_capture.

**int ndigo_stop_capture(ndigo_device *device)**

.. _Section 3.6:

Readout
-------


**int ndigo_read(ndigo_device *device, ndigo_read in *in, ndigo_read_out *out)**

Return a pointer to an array of captured data in **read_out**. The result can contain any number
of packets of type **ndigo_packet. read_in** provides parameters to the driver. A call to this
method automatically allows the driver to reuse the memory returned in the previous call.


Returns an error code as defined in the structure **ndigo_read_out**.


**int ndigo_acknowledge(ndigo_device *device, ndigo_packet *packet)**


Acknowledge all data up to the packet provided as parameter. This is mandatory if
**acknowledge_last_read** in the **ndigo_read_in** structure is set to **false** for calls to **ndigo_read**.


This feature allows to either free up partial DMA space early if there will be no call to
**ndigo_read** anytime soon. It also allows to keep data over multiple calls to **ndigo_read** to avoid
unnecessary copying of data.

**int ndigo_process_tdc_packet(ndigo_device *device, ndigo_packet *packet)**

Call on a TDC packet to update the timestamp of the packet with a more accurate value.
If called more than once on a packet the timestamp will be invalid.


Input Structure ndigo read in
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


**ndigo_bool_t acknowledge_last_read**

If set **ndigo_read** automatically acknowledges packets from the last read.


Input Structure ndigo read out
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


**ndigo_packet *first_packet**

Pointer to the first packet that was capture by the call of ndigo_read.

**ndigo_packet *last_packet**

Address of header of the last packet in the buffer.

**int error_code**

#define NDIGO_READ_OK 0

#define NDIGO_READ_NO_DATA 1

#define NDIGO_READ_INTERNAL_ERROR 2


**const char *error_message**


Other Functions
---------------

LED control
~~~~~~~~~~~


There are six LEDs on the front panel. The intensity of the red and green part can be set from
**0** to **255**. There is no blue component in the current version. Per default all LEDs are set to
**auto mode**. This means that used channels are lit **green**, activity is shown as **yellow** on
overflow is shown as **red**.


**int ndigo_set_led_color(ndigo device *device, int led, unsigned short r, unsigned short g,
unsigned short b)**


Set the LED to the selected color. No automatic updates are performed.


**int ndigo set led automode(ndigo device *device, int led)**

Let the selected LED be controlled by hardware.
