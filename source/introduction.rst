    This User Guide is under active development and is subject to major 
    changes.

.. The Ndigo6G-12 offers 6400 Msps sample rate, 12 bits resolution and a greatly
.. improved readout rate of 6000 MB/s.  

.. The unit is a combined ADC/TDC board for the acquisition of pulses in time of
.. flight applications. It builds on the established Platform of the Ndigo5G-10
.. but takes it to the next level both in performance and flexibility.

.. The Ndigo6G-12 was specifically designed for time-of-flight applications like
.. LIDAR or TOF mass spectrometry. Pulse arrival times can be measured with an
.. accuracy down to 5 ps together with information on pulse shape such as area or
.. amplitude. 

.. Four channels with 1600 Msps at 12 bit resolution can be acquired
.. independently. Alternatively, the four channels can be combined into two
.. channels or decreased to a single channel. This way, either a higher temporal
.. resolution up to 6400 Msps or a larger dynamic range can be achieved.

.. Features
.. --------

.. - **12 bit** dynamic range

.. - Up to **6.4 Gsps** sample rate (in 1 channel mode) for increased resolution
..   in time domain.

.. - Up to **four ADC channels** for your individual measurement setups.

.. - **Four TDC channels** with a resolution of **12** |nbws| **ns**.

.. - Digital input with TDC that can also be used for gating and triggering.

.. - 2\ :sup:`nd` digital input for gating or triggering.

.. - PCIe3 x8 1.1 with **XYZ** |nbws| **MB/s throughput** for simple and fast
..   data transfer to most PCs.

.. - **Synchronization of up to eight boards** via reference clock if more than
..   four ADC or TDC channels are required.

.. - **Unlimited multihit** capabilities.

.. - Continuous ADC readout rate of approx. **6000** |nbws| **MB/s**.

.. - **Zero suppression** reducing PCIe load.

.. - Onboard 10 |nbws| MHz clock with a time base of **50** |nbws| **ppb** or the
..   ability to use an external 10 |nbws| MHz clock.
