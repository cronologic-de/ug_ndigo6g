Introduction
============

The Ndigo6G-12 offers up to 6.4 |nbws| Gsps sample rate, 12 |nbws| bits
resolution and a greatly improved redout rate of 6000 |nbws| MB/s.

The unit is a combined ADC/TDC board for the acquisition of pulses in
time-of-flight applications. It builds on the established platform of the
Ndigo5G-10, but takes it to the next level both in performance and flexibility.

The Ndigo6g-12 was specifically designed for time-of-flight applications like
LIDAR or TOF mass spectrometry. Pulse arrival times can be measured with an
acurac down to 5 |nbws| ps together with information on the pulse shape, such
as area or amplitude.

Four channels with 1.6 |nbws| Gsps at 12 |nbws| bit resolution can be acquired
independently. Alternatively, the four channels can be combined to to two or
to one channel, increasing either the dynamic range or the sample rate.

Features
--------
