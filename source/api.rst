    %\RaggedRight

The API is a DLL with C linkage. The functions provided by the DLL are declared
in |br| :code:`Ndigointerface.h`.



Constants
---------

:cpp:`#define NDIGO_CHANNEL_COUNT 4`
    The number of analog input channels.

:cpp:`#define NDIGO_GATE_COUNT 4`
    The number of gating blocks.

    The number of triggers. Two per analog input, one per digital input plus some specials.

:cpp:`#define NDIGO_ADD_TRIGGER_COUNT 6`
    Additional set of triggers for digital inputs.




Initialization
--------------

:cpp:`int ndigo_count_devices(int *error_code, char **error message)`
    Return the number of boards that are supported by this driver in the system. 

:cpp:`int ndigo_get_default_init_parameters(ndigo_init_parameters  *init)`
    Get a set of default parameters to feed into **ndigoinit().**
    This must always be used to initialize the **ndigo_init_parameter** structure.

:cpp:`ndigo_device *ndigo_init(ndigo_init_parameters *params, int *error_code, char **error_message)`
    Open and initialize the Ndigo board with the given index.
    With :cpp:`error_code` and :cpp:`error_message`
    the user must provide pointers where to buffers where error information
    should be written by the driver.
    The buffer for the error message must by at least **80 chars** long. 
    Params is a structure of type
    **ndigo_init_parameters** that must be completely initialized. 

:cpp:`int ndigo_close(ndigo_device *device)`
    Finalize the driver for this device. 




Structure :code:`ndigo_init_parameters`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:cpp:`int version`
    Must be set to :cpp:`NDIGO_API_VERSION`

:cpp:`int card_index`
    The index in the list of **Ndigo5G** boards that should be initialized. 
    There might be multiple boards in the system that are handled by this driver
    as reported by :cpp:`ndigo_count_devices`. This index selects one of them.
    Boards are enumerated depending on the PCIe slot. The lower the bus number
    and the lower the slot number the lower the card index.  int board_id This
    8-bit number is filled into each packet created by the board and is useful
    if data streams of multiple boards will be merged. If only **Ndigo5G**
    cards are used this number can be set to the card index. If boards of
    different types that use a compatible data format are used in a system
    each board should get a unique id.  Can be changed with |br|
    :cpp:`int ndigosetboardid(ndigodevice *device, int boardid)`. 

:cpp:`ndigo_bool_t use_external_clock`

    in order to set data window to correct position.  
    
:cpp:`ndigo_bool_t hptdc_sync_enabled`
    A **HPTDC** is connected to this board. Enables the clock and sync line
    from the **Ndigo5G** to the **HPTDC**. 

:cpp:`__int64 buffer_size[8]`
    The minimum size of the DMA buffer.
    If set to :cpp:`0` the default size of **16** |nbws| **MByte** is used.
    **Ndigo5G** only uses :cpp:`buffer_size[0]`.

:cpp:`int buffer_type`
    Must be set to :cpp:`NDIGO_BUFFER_ALLOCATE`.

:cpp:`__int64 buffer_address`
    Ignored. Might be used for future buffer types.

    Initialized by :cpp:`ndigo_get_default_init_parameters()`.
    The write pointer update is delay by this number of **4** |nbws| **ns**
    clock periods to hide race conditions between software and DMA. 


Status Information
------------------

Functions for Information Retrieval
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The driver provides functions to retrieve detailed information on the type
of board, its configuration, settings and state. The information is split
according to its scope and the computational requirements to query the
information from the board. 

:cpp:`int ndigo_get_driver_revision()`
    Returns the driver version, same format
    as ndigo_static_info::driver_revision.  This function does not require a
    present **Ndigo5G** device.

        #define NDIGO_ADC_MODE_C12 30 // not available on all boards
        #define NDIGO_ADC_MODE_D12 31 // not available on all boards

:cpp:`double bandwidth`
    Set to the minimum bandwidth required for the application.
    Lower bandwidth results in reduced noise. The driver will set the ADC
    to the minimum setting that has at least the desired bandwidth and report
    the selected bandwidth in the :cpp:`ndigo_param_info` structure.

.. raw:: latex

    \begingroup
    \bfseries

:cpp:`int auto_trigger_period` 

.. raw:: latex

    \endgroup

:cpp:`int auto_trigger_random_exponent`
    Create a trigger either periodically or randomly.
    With :math:`M` = :cpp:`auto_trigger_period` and
    :math:`N` = :cpp:`auto_trigger_random_exponent`, the number of clock cycles
    :math:`T` between triggers will be

    .. math::

        T = 1 + M + [1...2^N]

    where :math:`0 \leq M < 2^{32}` and :math:`0 \leq N < 32`.

    There is no enable or reset as the usage of this trigger can be configured
    in the trigger block channel source field.


:cpp:`int output_mode`

    Defines the data representation in the output. :cpp:`Signed16` scales and
    :cpp:`CUTSOM_INL` corrects the input. :cpp:`RAW` directly presents the
    ADC values.

    .. code:: c++

        #define NDIGO_OUTPUT_MODE_SIGNED16 0
        #define NDIGO_OUTPUT_MODE_RAW 1
        #define NDIGO_OUTPUT_MODE_CUSTOM 2
        #define NDIGO_OUTPUT_MODE_CUSTOM_INL 3


:cpp:`lut_func custom_lut`
    Look-up table. If the output_mode is set to :cpp:`NDIGO_OUTPUT_MODE_CUSTOM`
    or to :cpp:`NDIGO_OUTPUT_MODE_CUSTOM_INL`, this function is used for
    mapping from ADC value to output value. The driver will call this function
    with a value from :math:`-1` to :math:`+1` and the function must return the
    corresponding signed 16-bit value that the board should return for an
    input voltage relative to the full scale range.

:cpp:`typedef short (*lut_func)(int channel, float x)`
    This can be used, e.g., for custom INL, offset and gain correction that
    covers user front end electronics. It can also invert the signal or
    correct the effect of logarithmic input amplifiers etc.

    The look-up table is applied on the board, thus using it does not cause
    any additional CPU load.  In the mode
    :cpp:`NDIGO_OUTPUT_MODE_CUSTOM_INL` the on-board INL correction table is
    applied before the user function, while :cpp:`NDIGO_OUTPUT_MODE_CUSTOM`
    does not perform INL correction. In order to use the user LUT 
    functionality, :cpp:`lut_func` must be set to a pointer to the
    LUT-function



Structure :cpp:`ndigo_trigger`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:cpp:`short threshold`
    Sets the threshold for the trigger block within the range of the ADC data
    of :math:`-32768` and :math:`+32768`.

    For trigger indices :cpp:`NDIGO_TRIGGER_TDC` to 
    :cpp:`NDIGO_TRIGGER_BUS3_PE`, the threshold is ignored.

:cpp:`ndigo_bool_t edge`
    If set, this trigger implements edge trigger functionality. Else, this is a

    this is ignored.

    For trigger indices :cpp:`NDIGO_TRIGGER_TDC_PE` to
    :cpp:`NDIGO_TRIGGER_BUS3_PE`, this must be set.

:cpp:`ndigo_bool_t rising`
    If set, trigger on rising edges or when above threshold.

    For trigger indices :cpp:`NDIGO_TRIGGER_AUTO` and :cpp:`NDIGO_TRIGGER_ONE`
    this is ignored.

    For trigger indices :cpp:`NDIGO_TRIGGER_TDC_PE` to
    :cpp:`NDIGO_TRIGGER_BUS3_PE` this must be set.


.. _struct ndigotriggerblock:

Structure :cpp:`ndigo_trigger_block`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:cpp:`ndigo_bool_t enabled`
    Activate triggers on this channel.

:cpp:`ndigo_bool_t retrigger`
    If a new trigger condition occurs while the postcursor is acquired, the
    packet is extended by starting a new postcursor. Otherwise the new trigger
    is ignored and the packet ends after the precursor of the first trigger.

    The retrigger setting is ignored for the timestamp channel.

:cpp:`ndigo_bool_t reserved1`
    Defaults to :cpp:`false`. Do not change.

:cpp:`ndigo_bool_t reserved2`
    Defaults to :cpp:`false`. Do not change.

:cpp:`int precursor`
    Precursor in multiples of 3.2ns. The amount of data preceding a trigger
    that is captured.  The precursor setting is ignored for the timestamp
    channel.

:cpp:`int length`
    In multiples of 3.2 |nbws| ns.

    The total amount of data that is recorded in addition to the trigger
    window. Precursor determines how many of these are ahead of the trigger
    and how many are appended after the trigger. In **edge trigger mode**
    the trigger window always is **3.2** |nbws| **ns** wide. In
    **level trigger mode** it is as long as the trigger condition is fulfilled.

    The length setting is ignored for the timestamp channel.

:cpp:`int sources`
    A bit mask with a bit set for all trigger sources that can trigger this
    channel.

:cpp:`double minimum_free_packets`
    This parameter sets how many packets are supposed to t into the on-board
    FIFO before a new packet is recorded after the FIFO was full, i.e., a
    certain amount of free space in the FIFO is demanded before a new packet
    is written after the FIFO was full.

    As a measure for the packet length the gate length set by the user is used.
    The on-board algorithm checks the free FIFO space only in case the FIFO is
    full.  Therefore, if this number is :cpp:`1.0` or more, at least every second
    packet in the DMA buffer is guaranteed to have the full length set by the
    gate length parameters. In many cases smaller values will also result in
    full length packets. But below a certain value multiple packets that are
    cut off at the end will show up.

.. _struct ndigoextblock:

Structure :cpp:`ndigo_extension_block`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This structure configures how the inputs from the optional extension board
and signals from the synchronization bus are merged.

:cpp:`ndigo_bool_t enable`
    Enable routing of digital signal from Ndigo extension board to the
    according BUSx trigger unit.


:cpp:`ndigo_bool_t ignore_cable`
    If :cpp:`false` input signal and BUS signal are *OR*ed before routing to
    the according BUSx trigger unit. Otherwise only the signal from
    **Ndigo extension board** is used.

Readout
-------

:cpp:`int ndigo_read(ndigo_device *device, ndigo_read in *in, ndigo_read_out *out)`
    Return a pointer to an array of captured data in :cpp:`read_out`. The
    result can contain any number of packets of type
    :cpp:`ndigo_packet`. :cpp:`read_in` provides parameters to the driver.
    A call to this method automatically allows the driver to reuse the
    memory returned in the previous call.

    Returns an error code as defined in the structure :cpp:`ndigo_read_out`.


:cpp:`int ndigo_acknowledge(ndigo_device *device, ndigo_packet *packet)`
    Acknowledge all data up to the packet provided as parameter. This is
    mandatory if :cpp:`acknowledge_last_read` in the :cpp:`ndigo_read_in`
    structure is set to :cpp:`false` for calls to :cpp:`ndigo_read`.

    This feature allows to either free up partial DMA space early if there
    will be no call to :cpp:`ndigo_read` anytime soon. It also allows to keep
    data over multiple calls to :cpp:`ndigo_read` to avoid unnecessary copying
    of data.

:cpp:`int ndigo_process_tdc_packet(ndigo_device *device, ndigo_packet *packet)`
    Call on a TDC packet to update the timestamp of the packet with a more
    accurate value.  If called more than once on a packet the timestamp will
    be invalid.


Input Structure :cpp:`ndigo_read_in`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:cpp:`ndigo_bool_t acknowledge_last_read`
    If set :cpp:`ndigo_read` automatically acknowledges packets from the last
    read.


Output Structure :cpp:`ndigo_read_out`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:cpp:`ndigo_packet *first_packet`
    Pointer to the first packet that was capture by the call of ndigo_read.

:cpp:`ndigo_packet *last_packet`
    Address of header of the last packet in the buffer.

Other Functions
---------------

LED control
~~~~~~~~~~~

There are six LEDs on the front panel. The intensity of the red and green part
can be set from :cpp:`0` to :cpp:`255`. There is no blue component in the current
version. Per default all LEDs are set to auto mode. This means that used
channels are lit **green**, activity is shown as **yellow** on overflow is
shown as **red**.

:cpp:`int ndigo_set_led_color(ndigo device *device, int led, unsigned short r, unsigned short g, unsigned short b)`
    Set the LED to the selected color. No automatic updates are performed.


:cpp:`int ndigo set led automode(ndigo device *device, int led)`
    Let the selected LED be controlled by hardware.
